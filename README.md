MMIR Starter Kit
===========

MMIR - Mobile Multimodal Interaction and Rendering framework

----

This is an ALPHA version for the MMIR framework (CAUTION: significant parts of the framework -- such as the API, used technology etc. -- may still be subject to change)

As a goal, this frameworks aims to provide a lightweight multi-modal dialog manager that -- for instance -- can run on mobile devices. The base technology is HTML5 (JavaScript).

This StarterKit represents a small example application that can run locally in an (HTML5 capable) internet browser, and using the Cordova framework, it can be executed as an Android app.
