mmir-lib
========

https://github.com/mmig/mmir-lib


Source Code for the MMIR (Mobile Multimodal Interaction and Rendering) library

This is the mere source code of the bare library (i.e. without any tooling etc.)

Usually, the content of this repository (of the root directory)
would be placed within the directory `mmirf/` of the web application:

    ...
    /controllers/
    /mmirf/
    /models/
    /views/
    /index.html
    ...

For examples, see the [StarterKit][1] or the [minimal Cordova example][2].

#### Updating mmir-lib in your project

In order to update `mmir-lib` in your project, you should follow these steps

_Note: these directions assume, that your web application is located in the
       sub-directory `/www` of your project directory._  

 1. replace the contents of `/www/mmirf` with the new contents of this repository
    (e.g. the using `git subtree pull` command)
 1. update the _tooling_ in `/build` from the [mmir-tooling][3] repository, by
   1. replacing `/build` with the new contents of the _mmir-tooling_ repository
   1. executing the `ANT` build script from within `/build`
 1. _delete contents of `/www/gen`_
 1. re-build your web application, if necessary (e.g. run `cordova build`)

See also the [tools project][3] for scripts, resources etc. for compiling and generating resources
(e.g. for compiling JSON grammar files from the application's `config/languages/[language code]/`
directories into JavaScript files).

NOTE: Integration with / loading of Cordova is now designed to work with the _build process_
      of **Cordova 5** or later (see [MMIR skeleton project][2] for integration / tooling of the MMIR framework
      in combination with Cordova 5 and later versions).
